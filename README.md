  <h2>Responsiblities</h2>
  - UI programming -<br /><br />
    After getting introduced into the code by my lead programmer,<br />
    we planned ahead, using a class structure diagramm. (UML)<br />
    I wrote one before, but this was my first "serious" use, which helped me <b>A LOT</b>, when coding.<br />
    Another responsibility: A lot of code had to be replaced, as a lot was still prototype code, not modular enough for further use.<br /><br />
  - Assisting the team as a programmer -<br /><br />
  Helping my team with implementation of assets and ideas was a daily given.<br />
  Since the team was amazing, there was not much work here.<br />
  I also took over some bug search / fixing, that my lead engineer simply had no time to attend to.<br />
  This turned out to work out really well, we made a great team!<br /><br />

  <h2>Example scripts</h2>
  Here are some scripts, I'd like to show:<br /><br />
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/LumiToad/ArcanumFortuna/tree/main/systems/ui/ui_base">UI base structure</a></li>
    This one needs explanation. As I joined the team two weeks before release,<br />
    there was a lot of prototype UI code still in the game.<br />
    We tried to rip out most of it, but it wasn't possible.<br />
    In order to work around that,<br />
    I came up with this system to add new canvas layers above the game,<br />
    so that mouse interactions won't cancel each other out.<br />
    I wrote my own class structure diagramm for that and once my lead kind of approved it, (he had a lot todo!)<br />
    we used it to build a lot of the UI screens, you can see in the final game. It was a huge time saver!
    <li><a href="https://github.com/LumiToad/ArcanumFortuna/tree/main/systems/tutorial">The entire tutorial</a></li>
    This was a lot of work. Besides the old Tutorial, everything here is my work.<br />
    It builds upon the card battle phase system, which was already part of the game.<br />
    <li><a href="https://github.com/LumiToad/ArcanumFortuna/blob/main/systems/ui/screen_fade_overlay.gd">Multi purpose screen fade it / out</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/LumiToad/ArcanumFortuna/tree/main/systems/ui/new_deck_preview">Deck preview screen</a></li>
    There is more, as some UI has been adjusted to the new structure...
  </ul>
